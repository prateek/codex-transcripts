# Experiment: codex-transcripts

## Goal

Create a tool to export/publish Codex CLI session transcripts (Codex sessions history), adapted from claude-code-transcripts, with tests and guards against Codex session format changes.

## Where to look first

- See `references/index.md` for the inventory of repos, links, and notes.
- Cloned repos live under `references/repos/` and are ignored by git.
